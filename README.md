## 🧠 About the Project  

This project was created for my undergraduate **3D Graphics** course that explores the concepts of graphics pipelines, lighting/shading, modeling, texture mapping, and more with WebL.

The project investigates graphics concepts by:
- **Lighting & Shading** Diffuse lighting, point light source, per-fragment lighting calculations, normal transformations
- **3D Geometric Modeling** Procedural sphere generation through recursive subdivision, creating custom geometric primitives (rings and paths)
- **Texture Mapping** 2D textures applied to 3D spheres, environment mapping, texture management and binding
- **Transformations & Matrix Operations** Modeling Transformations, view transformations, Model-View matrix composition
- **WebGL Pipeline** Vertex and fragment shader, buffer management, attribute and uniform variable handling
